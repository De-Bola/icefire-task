My Solution to the icefire prison break task

How I solved it..

My thought process is that, I could get my passcode/id code/access code. Then I could somehow hotwire all the doors of this prison, by adding my access code to each door I pass through as I plot my escape from this place. 

But before this, I was of the opinion that a better way would be to get everyone's access codes and use that to get past their doors while escaping. I then realised that, this is a smart idea but it'll require too much resources and that if anything changes [like if more prisoners came in, then I'd also have to get their passes too].
